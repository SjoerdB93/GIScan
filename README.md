# GIScan
Simple tool to read and analyze existing GISAXS data. This software has only been tested on raw GISXAS-data obtained at
DESY in Germany in .cbf format. Any other type of data is unsupported. The program is mostly feature complete right now,
and is considered to be in beta state. Some code clean up is still needs to be done.
Loaded data can automatically be converted to angular data, q-space or pixels. Experimental parameters can be set in the
settings dialogue.

Note that this is still a beta version. The code is messy at the moment, a proper code clean up as well as some
documentation need to be done before declaring version 1.0. Testing is primarily done on Fedora Silverblue (Linux), but
this software should be compatible with any modern version of Linux, MacOS or Windows.

For any support or other questions, please contact me at info@sjoerd.se. Keep in mind that this program comes with 
absolutely no warranty or formal support.
